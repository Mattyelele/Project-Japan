Project Japan is a little RTM tool I started work on a few years ago for MW2 on the PS3 I never finished it. I did lose the source code but luckily I sent my best friend a copy of it and I was able to download it and decompile it! I was making this to learn C# but I kinda gave up but hopefully one day I'll go back to it and finish it :)



This tool uses the MetroFramework for the design and uses MW2Lib, PS3Lib and PS3Tmapi_net
